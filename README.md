# uberApp
Application allows passengers to arrange rides with drivers in their city. Created by Alexandra Duron and Graeme Somerville.

A simplified version of Uber we created as a practice project. This is the client side program.

* The program follows the MVC design pattern.
* User information is stored on a postgresSQL database we hosted on "heroku.com" (we chose heroku as it has a free option for hobbyists)
* JDBC is used to query/edit the database
* Client-Server communication is handled through java sockets
* Command Line Interface

### To Run
Compile the classes then run in any terminal with access to the internet
